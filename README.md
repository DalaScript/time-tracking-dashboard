## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- fetch API
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- bem - [Block Element Modifier](https://getbem.com/introduction/)
- scss - [Sassy Cascading Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/for/)

### What I learned

Nothing special but I practiced more on the fetch API

```js
fetch('./data.json')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => data)
  .catch(err => console.error(`There was an error: ${err}`));
```

### Continued development

First I want to finish the javascript course I'm taking on freecodecamp, I'm also going through the learning path on Frontendmentor, and after that I want to focus more on React, Next.js and Node.js.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - He is my hero, if I need something fast, if I can't understand something, or if I can't find it on the internet, I always ask him.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is my favorite documentation platform I've been using since I started programming, it's the best explained resource.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I'm always looking for news and listening to other developers, sharing their experiences so that I can see many different solutions to a problem.
